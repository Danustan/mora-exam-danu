    <h1>What is Mora Exams?</h1>
</center>
    <p>When sweeping over the ideas of how to choose the ways to advance the academic standards of Tamil-speaking students, our buddies thought of pilot examinations, which could boost the last-time preparations and be a way to appraise the students themselves at the very edge.</p>
<p>But providing a common exam paper and marking wouldn't help them , as they are very familiar to them. So, to add more and more spice,</p>
<ul>
    <li>The exam papers are set by popular and experienced teachers.</li>
    <li>The exam papers are set in a way that portrays the final examination environment. This helps students ensure time management.</li>
<li>We too release island ranks based on their z-scores.</li>

</ul>
<p>It vividly canvases the standards of the examinations and their potential among the students so that the students can adjust themselves to become more and more fit for the G.C.E. (A/L) examination, which makes their future more efficacious.</p>
